                    HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the most basic building
                    block of the Web. It defines the meaning and structure of
                    web content. Other technologies besides HTML are generally
                    used to describe a web page's appearance/presentation (CSS)
                    or functionality/behavior (JavaScript). "Hypertext" refers
                    to links that connect web pages to one another, either
                    within a single website or between websites. Links are a
                    fundamental aspect of the Web. By uploading content to the
                    Internet and linking it to pages created by other people,
                    you become an active participant in the World Wide Web. HTML
                    uses "markup" to annotate text, images, and other content
                    for display in a Web browser. HTML markup includes special
                    "elements" such as head, title, body, header,footer,
                    article, section, p, div, span, img, aside, audio, canvas,
                    datalist, details, embed, nav, search, output, progress,
                    video, ul, ol,and many others. An HTML element is set off
                    from other text in a document by "tags", which consist of
                    the element name surrounded by The name of an element inside
                    a tag is case-insensitive. That is, it can be written in
                    uppercase, lowercase, or a mixture. For example, the title
                    tag can be written as Title, TITLE, or in any other way.
                    However, the convention and recommended practice is to write
                    tags in lowercase.<br />

                    Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a stylesheet language used
                    to describe the presentation of a document written in HTML
                    or XML (including XML dialects such as SVG, MathML or
                    XHTML). CSS describes how elements should be rendered on
                    screen, on paper, in speech, or on other media. CSS is among
                    the core languages of the open web and is standardized
                    across Web browsers according to W3C specifications.
                    Previously, the development of various parts of CSS
                    specification was done synchronously, which allowed the
                    versioning of the latest recommendations. You might have
                    heard about CSS1, CSS2.1, or even CSS3. There will never be
                    a CSS3 or a CSS4; rather, everything is now just "CSS" with
                    individual CSS modules having version numbers.<br />

                    Getting set up Requirements All of the components in
                    Tailwind UI are designed for the latest version of Tailwind
                    CSS, which is currently Tailwind CSS v4.0. To make sure that
                    you are on the latest version of Tailwind, update via npm:
                    npm install tailwindcss@latest If you're new to Tailwind
                    CSS, you'll want to read the Tailwind CSS documentation as
                    well to get the most out of Tailwind UI. Optional: Add the
                    Inter font family We've used Inter for all of the Tailwind
                    UI examples because it's a beautiful font for UI design and
                    is completely open-source and free. Using a custom font is
                    nice because it allows us to make the components look the
                    same on all browsers and operating systems.<br />

                  <p>
                    JavaScript (JS) is a lightweight interpreted (or
                    just-in-time compiled) programming language with first-class
                    functions. While it is most well-known as the scripting
                    language for Web pages, many non-browser environments also
                    use it, such as Node.js, Apache CouchDB and Adobe Acrobat.
                    JavaScript is a prototype-based, multi-paradigm,
                    single-threaded, dynamic language, supporting
                    object-oriented, imperative, and declarative (e.g.
                    functional programming) styles. JavaScript's dynamic
                    capabilities include runtime object construction, variable
                    parameter lists, function variables, dynamic script creation
                    (via eval), object introspection (via for...in and Object
                    utilities), and source-code recovery (JavaScript functions
                    store their source text and can be retrieved through
                    toString()). This section is dedicated to the JavaScript
                    language itself, and not the parts that are specific to Web
                    pages or other host environments. For information about APIs
                    that are specific to Web pages, please see Web APIs and DOM.
                    The standards for JavaScript are the ECMAScript Language
                    Specification (ECMA-262) and the ECMAScript
                    Internationalization API specification (ECMA-402). As soon
                    as one browser implements a feature, we try to document it.
                    This means that cases where some proposals for new
                    ECMAScript features have already been implemented in
                    browsers, documentation and examples in MDN articles may use
                    some of those new features. Most of the time, this happens
                    between the stages 3 and 4, and is usually before the spec
                    is officially published. Do not confuse JavaScript with the
                    Java programming language — JavaScript is not "Interpreted
                    Java". Both "Java" and "JavaScript" are trademarks or
                    registered trademarks of Oracle in the U.S. and other
                    countries. However, the two programming languages have very
                    different syntax, semantics, and use.<br />

                    Welcome to the React documentation! This page will give you
                    an introduction to 80% of the React concepts that you will
                    use on a daily basis.

                    React apps are made out of components. A component is a
                    piece of the UI (user interface) that has its own logic and
                    appearance. A component can be as small as a button, or as
                    large as an entire page. React components are JavaScript
                    functions that return markup: function MyButton() { return (
                    I'm a button ); }

                    Millions of developers and businesses call GitHub home.
                    Whether you're scaling your development process or just
                    learning how to code, GitHub is where you belong.<br />
                    GitHub is a cloud-based platform where you can store, share,
                    and work together with others to write code.
                    <br />
                    Storing your code in a "repository" on GitHub allows you to:
                    <br />
                    Showcase or share your work.<br />
                    Track and manage changes to your code over time.<br />
                    Let others review your code, and make suggestions to improve
                    it.<br />
                    Collaborate on a shared project, without worrying that your
                    changes will impact the work of your collaborators before
                    you're ready to integrate them.<br />
